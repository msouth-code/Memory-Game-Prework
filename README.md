**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Miayunique South

Time spent: 5.5 hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
N/A

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
One challenge I faced was implementing the guess method. Since I'm not used to coding html, I wasn't quite sure how to approach the problem using the correct syntax so I did end up peeking at the given solution haha. In the end, though, I looked over the given solutionfor the function and saw a few similarities between the inplementation and what I've learned in my Java course. Having my Java knowledge is what made the HTML code a little easier to map and follow when I was reviewing the solution. However, even without that knowledge, I think the code is overall pretty digestible and one could understand it using logic.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
How do you add complicated elements like graphs, tables, mailing lists, etc. to a website using HTML? So much work went into creating these buttons, giving them sound, adding headers, and more and this program is fairly simple. I can only imagine what goes into a full-fledge website. Also, what similarities are there between HTML and Java? I noticed a couple while completing the assignment but I wonder how easy it is to transfer Java skills over to HTML.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on the project, I definitely would want to try to implement some of the bonus features. I would have liked to add pictures to the buttons, given the user 3 strikes, and added a clock. Additionally, if I knew how, I would have like to add a little animation at the top near the headers or one that gives the impression of an animation running behind or in front of the buttons. I feel like that would have been cool to implement. Also (this is just for my entertainment LOL), I would have liked to figure out how to change the laptop cursor. I've been on various websites that have customized cursors/mice and have always wondered how that was possible. :)
